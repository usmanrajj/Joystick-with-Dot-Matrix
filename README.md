In this Project we are using Joystick module with Arduino UNO to control 8x8 Dot Matrix Lights.

There are different types of Joystick.
Here We are using 2-Axis Joystick, so we can easily use it with this Matrix Module.

The joystick outputs an analog signal whose voltage varies between 0 and 5V. When you move the joystick along the X axis from one extreme to the other, the X output changes from 0 to 5V, and the same thing happens when you move it along the Y axis. And, when the joystick is centered (rest position), the output voltage is approximately half of VCC, or 2.5V.
